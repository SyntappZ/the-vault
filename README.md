## making this project

making this project took longer than expected due to learning vue, vuetify and firebase all at once.
i learnt a lot making this project and was very fun to make, i feel i have i nice grasp on vue now and will definitely be alble to build my next projects faster, i resently found out about vuex which would of helped me in this project a lot. this was also my first project connecting to a back end even tho its only firebase i still leant a lot about connecting to the back end and getting/adding/modifying data, thanks for taking a look at my code.
