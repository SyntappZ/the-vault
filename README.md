##Date: 21/04/2019

finished the layout and page animations i learnt quite a lot about vue today i feel like i understand more about props and $emit and i also learnt about lifecycle hooks, i still feel i have much to learn about these but i have a basic understanding now, v-bind is another thing i need to look into more too.
